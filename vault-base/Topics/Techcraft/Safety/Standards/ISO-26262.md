### Concept Phase

An **item** is a **system** that implements a function, or part of a function, at the vehicle-level.

A system is a set of **components**, or sub-systems, that relates at least a sensor, a controller and an actuator with one another.

A component is compromised of more than one hardware parts (e.g., microcontroller), or one or more software units.

An **item definition** lists information about an item, including,
* its boundary (i.e., what distinguishes it from its operational environment, including interfaces to and interactions with).
* its intended functionality,
* its (preliminary) architecture, and,
* its operational environment.
#### Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment (HARA)

##### Hazard Analysis
---
A **hazard** is a potential source of injury caused by malfunctioning behavior of the item (e.g., unintended acceleration).

A **hazardous event** is the occurrence of a hazard in a specific **operational situation** (e.g., unintended acceleration while parking in a crowded garage).

Using the item definition of an item, all hazardous events shall be identified.

For each hazardous event, assuming the associated hazard occurred,
* A class of **severity** (of injury) is assigned.
* A class of probability of **exposure** is assigned, denoting the likelihood for the vehicle to be in the associated operational situation (e.g., driving at 250 km/h is unlikely, parking in a crowded garage is likely).
* A class of **controllability** is assigned, denoting the likelihood that the affected user is able to gain sufficient control of the hazardous event, such that they are able to avoid injury.

For each hazardous event, based on the severity, exposure and controllability classes, an **Automotive Safety Integrity Level (ASIL)** is assigned, which may be either A, B, C or D.
