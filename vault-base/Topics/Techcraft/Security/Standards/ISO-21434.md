### Concept Phase

An **item** is a component, or a set of, that implements a function at the vehicle-level, and contains one or more **assets**.

Accordingly, an asset is an object with one or more **cybersecurity properties**, whose compromise can contribute to one or more **damage scenarios**.

Cybersecurity properties include,
* **Confidentiality**,
* **Integrity**,
* **Availability**,
* **Authenticity**,
* **Authorization**,
* **Non-repudiation**,
* **Privacy**, and,
* **Freshness**.

An **item definition** lists information about an item, including,
* its boundary (i.e., what distinguishes it from its operational environment, including interfaces to and interactions with).
* its intended functionality,
* its (preliminary) architecture, and,
* its operational environment.
#### Threat Analysis and Risk Assessment (TARA)

##### Threat Analysis
---
A **threat scenario** is a potential cause of compromise in one or more of the cybersecurity properties of one or more assets.

To identify threat scenarios, a threat-modelling approach based on the **STRIDE** framework (or an alternative framework) may be used.

In the STRIDE framework, six threat categories are defined, each corresponding to one or more cybersecurity properties, as shown below. 

| Threat Category         | Explanation                                                  | Cybersecurity Property        |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| Spoofing                | Attacker pretends to be someone or something else.           | Authenticity                  |
| Tampering               | Attacker changes data in-transit or stored.                  | Integrity                     |
| Repudiation             | Attacker performs actions that cannot be traced back to him. | Non-repudiation,<br>Freshness |
| Information Disclosure  | Attacker gets access to data in-transit or stored.           | Confidentiality,<br>Privacy   |
| Denial-of-Service (DoS) | Attacker interrupts a system's legitimate operation.         | Availability                  |
| Elevation of Privilege  | Attacker performs actions he is not authorized to perform.   | Authorization                 |

Using the item definition of an item, assets, and corresponding cybersecurity properties, are identified, after which relevant threat categories from STRIDE are applied, formulating the different threat scenarios associated with the item.
##### Impact Rating
---
For each damage scenario, an impact rating is determined, which may be *severe*, *major*, *moderate*, or *negligible*.

The impact rating is based on four factors: *Safety*, *Financial*, *Operational*, and *Privacy* *(SFOP)*.

| Impact Rating | Criteria (Safety) |
| ------------- | ----------------- |
| Severe        |                   |








**Threat Analysis and Risk Assessment (TARA)** is a systematic approach to,









### Definitions
---
* Assets, and threats.
	* **Cybersecurity Property** - An attribute that can be worth protecting (e.g., confidentiality, integrity, availability).
	* **Asset** - An object with one or more *cybersecurity properties* whose compromise can lead to one or more *damage scenarios*.
	* **Threat Scenario** - A potential cause of compromise of *cybersecurity properties* of one or more *assets*, in order to realize a *damage scenario*.
	* **Impact** - Estimate of magnitude of a *damage scenario*.
* Items, and components.
	* **Item** - A *component*, or a set of, that implements a function at the vehicle-level, and contains one or more *assets*.
	* **Component** - A part that is logically and technically separable.
	* **Architectural Design** - Representation that allows for identification of *components*, their boundaries, interfaces, and interactions.
* Attacks, and vulnerabilities.
	* **Attack Path** - A set of deliberate actions to realize a *threat scenario*.
	* **Attack Feasibility** - An attribute of an *attack path*, describing the ease of successfully carrying out an *attack path*.
	* **Vulnerability** - A *weakness* that can be exploited as part of an *attack path*.
	* **Weakness** - A defect or characteristic that can lead to undesired behavior.
* Concept.
	* **Cybersecurity** - A condition in which *assets* are sufficiently protected against *threat scenarios*.
	* **Cybersecurity Risk** - Effect of uncertainty on cybersecurity, expressed in terms of *attack feasibility* and *impact*.
	* **Cybersecurity Goal** - High-level cybersecurity requirement, associated with one or more *threat scenarios*.
