In an *AUTOSAR* system (e.g., a vehicle), the application software is organized into components.

Modelling of SW-Component(s) takes place at multiple stages.
* First, port(s) and connection(s) across the different SWC(s) are specified.
* Second, the internal behavior of every SWC is specified, in terms of event(s) and runnable(s).
* Third, an implementation is specified (e.g., C-code implementation of every runnable).

*Note:* Any implementation depends on the Run-Time Environment (RTE) for the handling of event(s), and communication across SWC(s).
