*Media Access Control (MAC) Security* protocol, termed *MacSec*, is an Ethernet Network Security protocol, operating at the *Data-Link* layer of the *OSI* model. [1]

It is meant to secure Ethernet frames between two or more entities within a *LAN*, collectively forming a *Connectivity Association (CA)*.

*MacSec* relies on *MAC Security Key Agreement (Mka)* protocol to authenticate entities, and exchange session-key(s).
### Connectivity Association (CA)
---
An entity within a *CA* must possess its key, abbreviated as *CAK*.

*Note:* A *CAK* must be an *AES-128*, or an *AES-256* key.

Every *CAK* (i.e., *CA*) is identified via its number, abbreviated as *CKN*.
