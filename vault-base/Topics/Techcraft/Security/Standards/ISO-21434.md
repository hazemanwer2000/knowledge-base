	* **Weakness** - A defect or characteristic that can lead to undesired behavior.
* Concept.
	* **Cybersecurity** - A condition in which *assets* are sufficiently protected against *threat scenarios*.
	* **Cybersecurity Risk** - Effect of uncertainty on *cybersecurity*, expressed in terms of *attack feasibility* and *impact*.
* Items, and components.
